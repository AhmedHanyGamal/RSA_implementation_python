# RSA Algorithm Implementation

This is an implementation of the asymmetric encryption algorithm RSA.

If you plan on using this implementation then you need to know how asymmetric encryption works.
Here is a [video](https://youtu.be/p_LWJgTBIFs?si=CcijVM3yla6kqJOS) that explains it.


## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have Python installed (version 3.6 and above).

If you don't already have it installed, download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).


## Installation and Usage

1. Download the files either by Git or by downloading the ZIP file.
  - If you don't know how to install the ZIP file (and I know some of you don't :^) ), just click [here](https://github.com/AhmedHanyGamal/RSA_implementation_python/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. Open "program.py".
3. Run the file.


## Note

The main purpose of this implementation was to learn RSA and how it works, and to make sure that I fully understand RSA. As there is no better way to make sure that you understand something than to actually implement it. As a result, I didn't put any thought into writing clean/readable code (specially the extended euclidean algorithm file, since I implemented it from scratch and had a very difficult time finding proper names for the variables :') ) so please, take it easy on me.


## Contributions

Open to contributions.
Would appreciate contributions related to best practices and potential vulnerabilities in the code.
And I wouldn't mind any help with the readablity and cleanliness of the code either :3
