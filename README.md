# RSA Algorithm Implementation

This is my implementation of the asymmetric encryption algorithm RSA

If you plan of using my implementation then you need to know how asymmetric encryption works
Here is a [video](https://youtu.be/p_LWJgTBIFs?si=CcijVM3yla6kqJOS) that explains it


## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have python installed (version 3.6 and above)

If you don't already have it installed, you can follow these steps:
1. Open google and search for "python download".
2. You will find [www.python.org](https://www.python.org), open it.
3. Press "Download python".


## Installation and Usage

1. Download the files either by Git or by downloading the ZIP file.
  - If you don't know how to install the ZIP file (and I know some of you don't :^) ), just follow these steps:
    - press the green button that says "<> code".
    - Click on "Download ZIP".
    - After you finish downloading, extract the files.
2. Open "program.py".
3. Run the file.


## Notes

1. The main purpose of this implementation was to learn RSA and how it works, and to make sure that I fully understand RSA. As there is no better way to make sure that you understand something than to actually implement it.
2. As the main purpose was implementing RSA, I didn't put any thought into writing clean and readable code (specially the extended euclidean algorithm file, since I implemented it from scratch and had a very difficult time finding proper names for the variables :') ) so please, be easy on me in that part.
